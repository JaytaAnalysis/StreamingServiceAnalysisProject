## Collecting Data and Cleaning It
## Analyzing Data with SQL
## Data Visualizations
I created all of my data visualizations using Tableau, and they are all posted on my [Tableau profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jay5937/vizzes).

The data viz I created for the filming locations of titles includes a slider bar that can filter by range of years. To see a more complete visualization of the film location data, you can access it directly [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jay5937/viz/GlobalDistributionofFilmLocations/Sheet1). The map presented here shows the cumulative film location distribution across the world from 2006 to 2021. I used a logarithmic color scale to denote how many titles were filmed in each country because the film counts span a few orders of magnitude. Countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and India had thousands of films; countries like China, Mexico, and Australia had hundreds of films; countries like South Africa, Colombia, and Poland had tens of films.
This film location data can be useful because they indicate what countries are popular to create films in. For companies or filmmakers deciding on film locations, examining this data can help them decide where to film. In addition, there are more avenues of research that could explore the significance of film locations: examining the relationship between film locations and various indicators of success of the film, examining correlations between film locations and geopolitical alliances and hostilities, and examining correlations between film locations and countries' GDP.
